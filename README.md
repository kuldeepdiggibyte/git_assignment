1. **Cloned the Repository from GitHub**:
   - I initiated the process by cloning the repository from GitHub, creating a local copy on my machine.

2. **Created a New Branch**:
   - I used the command to create a new branch. This allowed me to work on a separate branch without affecting the main codebase.

3. **Switched to the New Branch**:
   - I switched to the newly created branch using the appropriate Git command. This ensured that my changes would be isolated to this branch.

4. **Made Changes to the Code**:
   - Within my local copy of the repository, I modified the code according to the task or feature I was working on.

5. **Committed Changes to the New Branch**:
   - After making the necessary changes, I committed them to the new branch. Each commit had a descriptive message explaining the purpose of the changes.

6. **Switched Back to the Original Branch**:
   - To return to the original branch (usually the main or master branch), I used the Git command to switch back.

7. **Merged the New Branch**:
   - Once I was satisfied with the changes in the new branch, I merged it back into the original branch. This combined my work with the existing codebase.

8. **Pushed Changes to the Original Branch**:
   - I pushed the changes to the original branch on GitHub, ensuring that they were reflected in the remote repository.

  Resolve the Conflict Locally:
When the pull request encounters a conflict, I’ll manually resolve it by editing the affected files.
Continue the Rebase:
git rebase --continue

This command instructs Git to proceed with applying the remaining commits from the pull request.

Push the Updated Branch:
Once everything is resolved, pushed the updated branch to the remote repository:
git push origin feature-branch

Update the Pull Request:
Back in the pull request on GitHub, the conflict should now be resolved.

  Create a Feature Branch:
Switch to the New Branch:
 I switched to the feature-branch.
I added and committed these changes to the feature-branch.
Using git cherry-pick, I applied the changes from the identified commits to the target branch.
</p><br>
<p>Create a Feature Branch
Within my local copy of the repository, I opened the file and made necessary changes to the code.
I added and committed these changes to the feature-branch.
Resetting Commits:
I used the git reset command to move the branch pointer to a different commit.
The specific commit I wanted to reset to was identified using its hash.
Verifying the Reset:
I verified that the reset was successful by checking the commit history using git log.
The commit hash or reference was provided as an argument to git revert.
